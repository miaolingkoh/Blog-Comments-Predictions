# Blog-Comments-Predictions
Machine Learning tasks  using Spark.

In this assignment you will try to predict the number of comments that a blog post receives based on features of the post. You will get the data from the UCI Machine Learning Archive here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/BlogFeedback. The data were originally used in a paper by Krisztian Buza (2014): Feedback Prediction for Blogs. In Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery (pp. 145-152), available at http://www.cs.bme.hu/~buza/pdfs/gfkl2012_blogs.pdf.

You will use at least three different Machine Learning methods, reporting on the results of each one of them.
